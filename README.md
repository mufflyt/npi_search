# npi_search
Takes names and searches them against the NPPES database using the NPPES API function.  

I have a list of names that I would like to search for their NPI number using the NPI API (https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help-api). NPI number is a unique identifier number. There are about 45,000 names that I want to see if there is a match in the csv file to the API. There is documentation of the API listed above and this is also helpful (https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/demo?version=2.1). My goal is to get the correct NPI and all data as possible from the API. The example API call would be: https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/?number=&enumeration_type=NPI-1&taxonomy_description=&first_name=kale&use_first_name_alias=&last_name=turner&organization_name=&address_purpose=&city=&state=&postal_code=&country_code=&limit=&skip=&version=2.1. Ultimately I want to use the location data for geocoding and to create a map.
